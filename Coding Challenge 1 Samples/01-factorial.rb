# Write a method that takes an integer `n` in; it should return
# n*(n-1)*(n-2)*...*2*1. Assume n >= 0.
#
# As a special case, `factorial(0) == 1`.
#
# Difficulty: easy.

def factorial(n)
  return n==0 ? 1 : (1..n).inject(:*)		# If n is 0 return 1, otherwise use product of all numbers from 1 to n
end

# These are tests to check that your code is working. After writing
# your solution, they should all print true.
