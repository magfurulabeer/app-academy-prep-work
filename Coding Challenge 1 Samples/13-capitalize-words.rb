# Write a method that takes in a string of lowercase letters and
# spaces, producing a new string that capitalizes the first letter of
# each word.
#
# You'll want to use the `split` and `join` methods. Also, the String
# method `upcase`, which converts a string to all upper case will be
# helpful.
#
# Difficulty: medium.

def capitalize_words(string)
  string.split.map(&:capitalize).join(" ")	# Split into words, capitalize each word, join with a space
end

# These are tests to check that your code is working. After writing
# your solution, they should all print true.
